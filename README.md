# Assembly-X86-problems
These are my Assembly-X86 problems!I have chosen programming in this language to deeply understand how memory actually works,how an operating system
is communicating with the computer resources,and,why not,to challenge myself!
To run every program in Linux terminal,write the following commands:gcc -m32 [file_name] -o [executable_name_you_want],then ./[executable_name_you_want]
-Program nr1 takes as input from user a natural number and prints the number of 1 bits.
-The program nr2 prints the maximum value of an array,stocked in memory.
-The third one checks if an array is strictly sorted in increasing order.It prints 0 if its sorted,otherwise the position where the condition isnt satisfied anymore.
-Program no 4 takes as input 2 natural numbers and swaps them,then prints them.
-The fifth program checks if a number,taken as input,is either positive,either zero or either negative.
